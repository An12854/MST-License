# MST-License

MIT License with an unhealthy dose of Minecraft memes sprinkled in.

**Disclaimer:** I am **NOT** a lawyer, you shouldn't use this in any project and I'm not responsible for any legal troubles you get into, this is just as a bad joke.

## Why does this exist?

I'm bored, I don't know what to say, I don't aspire to be a professional programmer so I just do whatever I feel like doing.
It's also my way to communicate through my anxiety problems, I feel confortable with memes and speak through them.
